# MERGETOK

A contract to create and merge ERC20 tokens, on the Kiln testnet.

(will not work for "create token", as you have to send ether)

<h3> What's the idea? </h3>

Send 2 different tokens to the contract, and get a new token made out of both.

Merges between tokens of the same tier result in a higher tier token.

Claim existing tokens from the contract to merge with yours.

Seed your own tokens to the contract so others use them to merge.
